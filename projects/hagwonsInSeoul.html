            This is an infographic about Hagwons(Korean term of private academies)in Korea’s capital, Seoul. With this infographic, I express that “Seoul's creativity derives from various education executed in Seoul. Much attention and demand on education brought out many forms of education that are to help or complement public education. Hagwon culture, especially, takes the largest importance among them. Let's learn about the Hagwon culture and its present status.”

          <h4>Process</h4>
          <p>The full name of the course I worked on this project was "Information & Interaction design” with this project, I could practice on developing the topic, collecting and analyzing data, effectively visualizing data, and making efficient layout regarding the size of paper

            This project was an individual assignment. In order to develop this project, I took the process of:
            
             
            
            <p>1. Choosing the topic. Finding data and proceeding designs that I can refer to</p>
            <p>2. Re-organizing data and making 9uestions I would answer.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            How many Hagwons are there in Seoul?<br>
            What kinds of people are the stakeholders of Hagwon?<br>
            On what purpose do people attend Hagwon education?<br>
            What kinds of Hagwons are there in Seoul?<br>
            Where are the places with many Hagwons are concentrated in?<br>
            What kinds of Hagwons are famous in different departments in Seoul?<br>
            What kinds of Hagwons were on trend in Seoul?<br>
            Where do people get information about Hagwons in Seoul?<br>
            Where and which are the Hagwons are feathered in Seoul?<br>
            </p>
            
             
            
          <p>3. Finding right diagrams for the data and questions.</p>
            
          <p>4. Designing the objects (texts, icons, charts..)</p>
            
          <p>5. Laying them out and adjusting</p>
            
             
            
            I also worked through many iterations, especially in order to organize the layout.
            
            After working with sketches I decided to set a big map on the centre of the page and group the questions that can be answered. So I gave some of the information in the map together and put other on the sides.</p>

            <h4>Reflections</h4>
          <p>Through this project, I learned.

                Dealing with data was what I learned from the most. And the different ways to express data using graphical components, through using appropriate diagrams. I also learned a lot of adobe illustrator functions, by studying how to efficiently organize many shapes.
                
                 
                
                I used the metaphor of library to indicate Seoul, the metaphor of bookcases to show the number of Hagwons in each department, and metaphor of a book to indicate certain Hagwons. But in the final turn, the metaphors are not shown quite explicitly. Hagwons look like books, but the holistic view doesn't look like it is containing the meaning of the library. I would amplify it if I do it differently.</p>
